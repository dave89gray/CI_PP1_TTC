## Design

### Design Choices:
This website was designed with the idea to promote a professional and efficient company that can work in different industries while working to the highest standard.
There has been box-shading added to two pages, Meet the Team and Projects, so that these stand out.

### Colours:
The colors chosen were punchy, that stood out in contrast of each other. The background color throughout the website resembles a white chalk that evokes thoughts of whiteboards and chalk, staples of engineering companies while it provides good contrast. The other two colors primarily used resemble steel which is a major part of each industry that we work within. The contrast between these colors with the background color is excellent.

### Fonts:
Montserrat was used throughout the body of the website, while Roboto was used for the Navigation menu and for the headings. Montserrat lettering is said to have work, dedication, care, color, contrast, light and life, day and night which sounded very much like what T&T Consulting want to be seen as as a company. Roboto is said to have a mechanical skeleton which fitted the engineering while having natural reading rhythm which made it perfect for the heaadings and navigation menu. Sans Serif was used as a fall back should one of these fonts fail in a browser.

### Structure
The website is laid out in an easy to read, easy to follow manner where the information that we want to present stands out. The index page has an image of a warm evening with renewble energy equipment that is supposed to ellicit a positive feeling from the user. The Navigation menu and Footer are used throughout each page to give the user consistency and a familiar feeling when going through each page.
The website contains rour separate pages:
- A home page with a welcoming image and information about comapny work flows.
- An about us page that details company values and a section that allows to user to get familiar with some of the team.
- A projects pages that offers insight into the different areas of engineering that we offer.
- A contact us page that has a contact form, company contact information and a map that allows users to locate the office.
