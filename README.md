Welcome to T&T Consulting. 
<br>
This is a website that showcases the expertise of Engineering Consultants and offers potential clients the opportunity to review past projects, see the skillset from consultants on offer and the chance to book consultation appointments so that T&T Consulting can fulfill the customers needs. 
<br>
This site is targeted towards Oil & Gas or Renewable Energy companies that manufacture turnkey projects and are looking for expertise in finding solutions to their issues.
There is a section dedicated to allowing the user to get to know some of the managers and employees to give them a better overall feeling about the website.
<br>
T&Tâ€™s portfolio of projects and their extensive experience is on view through the Projects section while the site also allows potential clients to submit their details and make a request for consultation.
<br>
Thank you for visiting my project. I am always looking to improve and learn so please feel free to go to my GitHub and reach out to me with any improvements or suggestions you may have.
